DAACS provides personalized feedback about students’ strengths and weaknesses in terms of key academic and self-regulated learning skills, linking them to the resources to help them be successful students.

Currently, most institutions address this issue in two steps: (1) administer a required placement exam to incoming students (that assesses only reading, writing, and mathematics); and (2) place students into a remediation program if they do poorly on the placement exam. Unfortunately, this approach has been shown to be ineffective. Placement exams fail to accurately predict student success and remediation programs hinder progress toward a degree since the majority of students drop out of these noncredit courses that operate in isolation from the classroom, with no regard for program of study requirements. We propose to replace this faulty system with a formative assessment as means for students to assess their abilities and then develop personalized strategies, with guidance, to attain college-level skills. 1.1 What is DAACS? A formative assessment and technology framework that assess and provide feedback on: -Reading -Writing -Mathematics -College Skills “College Skills” is broad-based psychometric exam that will develop a picture of the student’s motivation, grit (stick-to-it and resilience), meta-cognition (thinking, planning, and assessment / reassessment of approaches to learning), etc. Each assessment (with the exception of the writing portion) will be comprised of a pool of test questions. 1.1.1 Key Feature List The DAACS Application framework provides post-secondary institutions with the automated ability to: -deliver the four assessments to students, -collect and store the results of those assessment, -refer the student to online resources that may improve their assessment scores and, -provide access to the store data for academic counselors and researchers. The aforementioned combined functionality is what we refer to as the “DAACS Engine”. 1.2 Why is DAACS necessary? College placement exams (e.g. Accuplacer, ACT Compass): -Fail to predict college success (Bettinger, Evans, &amp; Pope, 2011; Belfield &amp; Crosta, 2012) -Have issues related to reliability and validity (Mellard &amp; Andreson, 2007) -Don’t provide students with meaningful and/or actionable feedback -Expensive 1.3 Review of Literature supporting DAACS 1.4 Implementation considerations. 1.4.1 Three levels of student interaction with DAACS. 1.4.2 Role of advisors and mentors.

The author assumes the use of Amazon cloud services. However, the reader may safely choose any environment capable of operating the required version of the Linux operating system (e.g. other virtualization technology, physical platform, etc.). 4.2 Application Architecture 4.3 Installation This manual assumes that the reader is familiar with Amazon Web Services EC2 and has an established AWS environment. For more information regarding getting started with AWS, please see &lt;a href’“http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html”&gt;Amazon AWS setup Generic Steps to install DAACS: Create AWS EC2 instance Select the proper Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and install the image Java install Docker install System configuration Install daacsweb and daacsapi Docker containers What am I missing?
